This unit introduces you to the concept of using loops in code.

They might look a bit scary but you’ll get the hang of them very quickly.

### A for loop

```js

var total= 0                                // counter variable
for(var ctr = 0; ctr <= input0; ctr++) {    // loop up to input0
  total = total + ctr                       // increase total by the loop count
  console.log(total)                        // output the current total
}
```

### A while loop

```js
var ctr = 0                 // loop variable
var total = 0               // counter variable
while (ctr <= input0) {     // loop until ctr equals input0
  total = total + ctr++     // increase total by the loop count, increment the loop
  console.log(total)        // out the current total
}
```

1\. 1\. Experiments
===================

This window is provided for you to try out any code you develop. Use it to experiment and practise.

```js
// Write experimental code below
// 

console.log('your experiments file')
```

2\. Loops overview
==================

Before we start using loops in code, have a look at the Flode chart on the left.

It is a very simple loop but it’s a good place to start.

2\. 1\. A 'while' loop
======================

The code you see on the left is the exact equivalent of the Flode chart, but written in JavaScript.

Have a go at running the code:

```js

var counter = 0           // This is a 'counter' variable.

while ( counter <= 9 ) {  // If the condition is true, it loops back
  console.log(counter)
  counter = counter + 1   // Here we add 1 to the counter. This is known
                          // as 'incrementing' the counter.
}

```

[RUN]()

2\. 2\. While explained
=======================

Have a look at the code in more detail. It should be fairly easy to understand as it is very similar to the Flode chart.

The while code block
--------------------

Have a look at the `while` statement and it’s code block.

Every while statement looks like this:

```js
while ( some_condition ) {
  some_code
  some_more_code
  even_more_code
}
code carries on executing here 
once 'some_condition' is no longer true
```

What this says is the following: *“While the condition is true, execute all the code statements that occur **inside** it’s code block.”*

So, the loop will go round and round until the condition is false. Exactly the same as with the Flode chart.

In the code example, each time the statements in the code block are executed, the `counter` variable is incremented by one. Eventually, it hits the value `10`, at which point the condition becomes false and any statements after the code block execute.

Have a play
-----------

Feel free to change some of the values in the code and run it again using the button below. You can also add more than one to `counter` in each loop *iteration* and see what happens.

```js

var counter = 0           // This is a 'counter' variable.

while ( counter <= 9 ) {  // If the condition is true, it loops back
  console.log(counter)
  counter = counter + 1   // Here we add 1 to the counter. This is known
                          // as 'incrementing' the counter.
}

```

[RUN]()

Remember, if you want to, you can reset the code from the ‘Settings’ menu at the top. To do this, select the ‘Reset Chapter’ option.

2\. 3\. Beware infinite loops

A common mistake that people sometimes make with `while` loops is forgetting to increment the counter.

If, when you are completing the challenges in this section, you see that nothing happens, it is likely that you have created an infinite loop (you have forgotten to increment your counter).

Have a look at the code on the left. Can you see what is wrong with it?

If you run the code, it will run forever and the program will crash.

The reason for this is that you are never incrementing the `counter` variable, the condition is always true (less than 10), so it goes round and round the loop forever.

Run it then fix it
------------------

Press the ‘Run the code’ button below and you will see you never get anything back.

Your challenge is to fix the code by incrementing the counter properly within the loop. You should then see the correct output.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var loops = process.argv[2]

var ctr = 0
while (ctr < loops) {
  console.log(ctr)
}
```

[RUN THE CODE]()

**Important:** if nothing happens when you press the run button once you have fixed the code, you may need to go back one page then forward again to refresh it.

3\. Challenges
==============

Now it’s time to try some challenges that will test you on what you have learned about loops so far. The challenges get more difficult as you progress - by the time you have completed them you will be ready to start on some more complex algorithms.

3\. 1\. Count from 0 to N
=========================

We will pass in a value, N. You should write a program that outputs all values from 0 up to an including N.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = +process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here

for (var i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}


```

[Check It!]()

3\. 2\. Count from N to 0
=========================

Beware the infinite loop! 

We will pass you a value, N. You should output every positive value from N down to and including 0.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = +process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here

```

[Check It!]()

3\. 3\. N to 0 or -N to 0
=========================

This is a tricky challenge for you.

We will pass in a value N. N can be positive or negative.

* If N is positive then output all values from N down to and **excluding** 0.
* If N is negative, then output every value from N up to and **excluding **0.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = +process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here



```

4\. Utility variables
=====================

We have covered utility variables before within our Flode units.

Recap
-----

Very often in a loop, you will need to update a value with each *iteration* of your loop. At the end of the loop you might want to do something with that value.

On the left is a good example of this shown in a Flode chart. The Flode chart is doing the following:

> Add up all the values between 0 and 10 and output the result.

Step through the chart and carefully watch the variable called `total`. You can see that the `total` variable is updated each time we pass through the loop. Once the loop is finished, we output the `total` that has been increasing with each *iteration* of the loop.

A number of the challenges that follow require you to use this technique, so make sure that you understand it.

4\. 1\. Equivalent code
=======================

On the left is the JavaScript code equivalent of the Flode chart from the previous page.

If you run the code you will see that it deals with the loop in exactly the same way as the Flode chart did.

```js

var counter = 1              // This is a 'counter' variable.
var total = 0                // This is our utility variable, 'total'

while (counter <= 10) {      // If the condition is true, it enters the loop
  total = total + counter    // We add the current value of 'counter' to 'total'
  counter = counter + 1      // Here we add 1 to the counter. This is known as
                             // 'incrementing' the counter.
  console.log( total )       // And finally, we output 'total'
}


```

[RUN THE CODE]()

5\. For loops
=============

So far you have learned about `while` loops. Now you are going to look at a different loop, which does the same thing, but with a different syntax (structure of statements) that makes it more suitable for particular tasks.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = process.argv[2]

// we will use this variable to keep up with the total
var total = 0              

for(var ctr= 0; ctr <= N; ctr++ ) {   // loop from 0 to 10
  total = total + ctr                 // add loop value to total
  console.log(total)                  // print current total
}

console.log( 'Final total: ' + total) // print final total

```

[RUN THE CODE]()

Have a look at the code on the left. It does the same thing as the `while` loop code written below.

```js
// Get input from the command line
var N = process.argv[2]

// we will use this variable to keep up with the total
var total = 0 

var ctr = 0           // loop variable
while(ctr <= N){      // loop 0 to 10 inclusive
  total = total + ctr // add loop value to total
  ctr = ctr + 1       // increment loop counter
  console.log(total)  // print current total
}

console.log( 'Final total : ' + total) // print final total
```

5\. 1\. For explained
=====================

Let’s look at the `for` loop in more detail.

```js

var total = 0
for(var ctr = 0; ctr <= N; ctr++ ) {
  total = total + ctr
  console.log(total)
}

```

Notice that there are 3 parts to the `for` statement. These are explained below.

Initialization
--------------

`var ctr = 0;`

This is the initialization part. You can have several JavaScript statements separated by a `,`. At the end you put a `;`

Condition
---------

`ctr \<= N;` this is the second part. It is the loop condition. The loop will execute until the condition is no longer true.

End of loop statements
----------------------

`ctr++` is the end of loop statement. Any JavaScript statements found here are executed at the end of the loop code block just before the condition is evaluated. If there is more than one end of loop statement, the statements are separated by `,`

What is ctr++?
--------------

Keep on working through this unit and you will find out!

5\. 2\. A bit more on for
=========================

Look at the code on the left and you will see that we have three different versions of code that do the same thing.

We have put the `console.log(total)` into the end of loop statements. If you run the code you should see for yourself that each output ends up the same.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = +process.argv[2]

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
console.log("Version 1")
{
  var total
  for(var ctr = 0, total = 0; ctr <= N; ctr++, console.log(total)) {
    total = total + ctr
  }
  console.log( 'Final total : ' + total)
}

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
console.log("Version 2")
{
  var total= 0                              // holds our total
  for(var ctr = 0; ctr <= N; ctr++){        // loop until input0
    total= total + ctr                      // add current loop value
    console.log(total)                      // output total so far
  }
  console.log('Final total : ' + total)     // output final total
}

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
console.log("Version 3")
{
  var total= 0                           // holds our total
  var ctr= 0                             // our loop counter
  while(ctr <= N) {                      // loop until input0
    total = total + ctr++                // update total, increment count
    console.log(total)                   // output total so far
  }
  console.log('Final total : ' + total)  // output final total
}
```

[RUN THE CODE]()

So what is the difference?
--------------------------

The `for` and `while` loops are *functionally equivalent*. The difference between the two comes from deciding which type of loop indicates the intention of the code better. You will also need to decide which type of loop is easier to understand for another person looking at your code.

The first example is bad.
-------------------------

1. It puts all of the loop initialization and variable logic into the `for` statement itself, which makes it harder to understand how the loop is being controlled.
2. This makes it much harder to comment in any meaningful way.
3. It is also much harder to validate the start and stop conditions at a glance.
4. Declaration of the `total` variable is required to give the variable scope, but initialization of `total` in the first section of the `for` loop leaves the potential for error between them.
5. Once you have seen `for` and `while` statements a few times, the loop as a whole will become easier to read, regardless of which loop is chosen.

Play

Feel free to experiment with the code on the left. If you mess it up, you can reset it by choosing the ‘Restore current files’ option in the ‘Settings’ menu at the top of this page.

5\. 3\. ctr++, ctr--
====================

`ctr++` is used in end of loop statements.

The `++` operator is called the *increment operator*. It increments a variable by one.

If `++` is written after the variable, like this: `c++`, the variable is incremented after the statement is evaluated. If `++` is written before, like this: `++c`, the variable is incremented before the statement is evaluated. This can affect the order of operations.

Below, `b` will end up with a value of 8 and `c` with a value of 5:

```js
var c= 4
var b= 2 * c++
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
```

But in the following example, `b` will end up with a value of 10 because `++c` sets `c = 5` before `2 \* c` is evaluated. The `c` variable as before will have a value of 5:

```js
var c= 4
var b= 2 * ++c
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
variable+= and variable-=
There is a shorthand solution too (a shorter and neater way to write the code). See below:
ctr += 10 is shorthand for ctr = ctr + 10
ctr -= 10 is shorthand for ctr = ctr - 10
ctr *= 10 is shorthand for ctr = ctr * 10
ctr /= 10 is shorthand for ctr = ctr / 10
```

6\. Challenges
==============

Here is a final set of challenges for you to complete. These challenges require the use of utility variables.

When you are completing the following challenges, please use the `for` statement, and not the `while`.

6\. 1\. Times table
===================

We will provide you with a number N. Output the times table for that number from 1 to 12.

So, if we pass in 6, you should output 6, 12, 18, 24 … 66, 72

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = +process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here


```

[Check It!]()

6\. 2\. Factorial
=================

X factorial, also written as X!X! , is X∗(X−1)∗(X−2)∗(X−3)....∗(1)X∗(X−1)∗(X−2)∗(X−3)....∗(1).

So, `4!` is `4\*3\*2\*1` = `24`.

We provide you with a value N. Calculate N! and output only the final result.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = +process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here

```

[Check It!]()

6\. 3\. Squared
===============

We will provide you with a value N. You should calculate the sum of each value of N squared from 0 up to and including N.

In mathematical notation, this is written as ∑Ni=0i2∑i=0Ni2

So if we passed in 3, you would output 02+12+22+32=14

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = +process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here


```

[Check It!]()

6\. 4\. X to the Y
==================

We will pass in 2 values, X and Y. You should calculate XYXY and output only the final result.

You will probably know that XYXY can be calculated as X times itself Y times.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var X = +process.argv[2]
var Y = +process.argv[3]

// Your code goes here


```

[Check It!]()

6\. 5\. Fibonacci 
==================

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …

The next number in the sequence is calculated by adding together the two numbers before it.

* We start off with 0 and 1
* The first 1 in the list above is found by adding the previous 2 numbers (0+1)
* The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
* Similarly, the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
* The 5 is (2+3)

and so on!

We will pass in a value N. Write a program that outputs the complete Fibonacci sequence for N iterations.

**Important:** If N is 0, then we expect to get an output of `0`. If N=1 then we expect `0, 1` etc.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var N = +process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here


```

[Check It!]()

7\. The 'break' statement
=========================

The `break` statement is a way of escaping a loop before the loop condition is met.

The `break` statement should never need to be used. Any program that seems to require a break statement can be rewritten to work equally well without it.

Have a look at the code on the left. The code shows a loop counting from 0 to 9\. However, the `break` statement in the loop is waiting to see if the loop index hits 7, and if it does, the loop is exited immediately.

This is an artificial example but it illustrates very well how break works.

```js

for (var i=0; i<10; i++ ) {
  console.log(i)
  if (i == 7) {
    break
  }
}
console.log('Finished.')
```

[RUN THE CODE]()

7\. 1\. The 'continue' statement
================================

The `continue` statement is used to jump over one iteration and continue the loop from the top.

The example on the left shows a loop that skips displaying the loop counter if it is an odd number.

Like `break` on the previous page, `continue` should not be necessary under any normal circumstances. Any code that seems to require a continue statement could be rewritten better without it.

```js

for (var i=0; i<10; i++ ) {
  if ( i % 2 == 1) {
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)  
}
console.log('Finished.')
```

[RUN THE CODE]()

7\. 2\. All done
================

Well done!
