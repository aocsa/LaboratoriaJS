You are going to learn about two-dimensional (2D) arrays by studying some theory and having a go at the challenges given.

Here is an example of two-dimensional data:

```
'Alice',23,'Blue',’Audi''Tariq',18,'Red','Mini'
'Bob',31,'Green','Renault' 
```

Here is how the data would be represented in a two-dimensional array:

```
people = [ ['Alice',23,'Blue','Audi'], ['Tariq',18,'Red','Mini'], ['Bob',31,'Green','Renault'] ]
```

1\. 1\. Experiments
===================

This window is provided for you to try out any code you develop. Use it to experiment and practise.

There is some starter code provided for you. This code will be explained on the following pages.

```js

// Creating a 2D array
var people = [ 
  ['Name', 'Age', 'Color', 'Car'], 
  ['Alice',23,'Blue','Audi'],
  ['Tariq',18,'Red','Mini'], 
  ['Bob',31,'Green','Renault'] 
]

// a string we will populate
var str= ''

// Looping through both dimensions
for (var i=1; i < people.length; i++ ) {
  
  for (var j=0, str=''; j < people[i].length; j++ ) {
    str += people[0][j] + '=' + people[i][j] + ' '
  }
  console.log(str)
  
}



```

2\. 2D arrays explained
=======================

So far, you have learned to use simple one-dimensional arrays:

```
numArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] strArray = ['Alice', 'Tariq', 'Bob'] 
```

In this unit, you are going to learn about two-dimensional arrays.

Arrays with two or more dimensions can be very useful. Two-dimensional arrays are the most common, so we are going to concentrate on these in this unit. However, it is worth knowing for future reference that more dimensions are possible.

2\. 1\. Example
===============

Imagine a classroom with rows of desks, and at each desk sits a student. Think of the 2D array as a grid, with rows going left to right and columns going up and down. Each element in the array can be referenced by specifying the row and column we wish to select.

The first element in the desks array, `desks[0]` contains an array with four elements, `[‘Adam’, ‘Ben’, ‘Carl’, ‘David’]`.

[

 [‘Adam’, ‘Ben, ‘Carl’, ‘David’],

 [‘Edward’, ‘Frank’, ‘Georgia’, ‘Helen’],

 [‘Isabelle', ‘Joan’, ‘Kelly’, ‘Linda’]

]

2\. 2\. Reading from a 2D array
===============================

```js
// declare our variable
var desks= []

//
// set rows 0,1,2 to contain an array of their own
//
desks[0]= ['Adam', 'Ben', 'Carl', 'David']
desks[1]= ['Edward', 'Frank', 'Georgia', 'Helen']
desks[2]= ['Isabelle', 'Joan', 'Kelly', 'Linda']


for(var row= 0; row < desks.length; row++){
	var studentRow= ''
	for(var column= 0; column < desks[row].length; column++){
		console.log('row[' +row+ ']col[' +column+ ']= ' +desks[row][column]);
	}
}

```

Have a look at the code on the left. This is what it does:

Define an array
---------------

```
2 var desks= [] 
```

To create a 2D array, we fill the regular array `desks` with an array for each element.

Populate the array
------------------

There are a number of equivalent ways to populate the same 2D array.

In the sample code, the 2D array has been populated like this:

```js

7  desks[0]= ['Adam', 'Ben', 'Carl', 'David']
8  desks[1]= ['Edward', 'Frank', 'Georgia', 'Helen']
9  desks[2]= ['Isabelle', 'Joan', 'Kelly', 'Linda']

```

Another way to populate the 2D array would be like this, using an array of arrays:

```js

desks= [
        ['Adam', 'Ben', 'Carl', 'David'],
        ['Edward', 'Frank', 'Georgia', 'Helen'],
        ['Isabelle', 'Joan', 'Kelly', 'Linda']
];

```

To make it simpler, everything in the example above could go on a single line, then the code would look like this:

```js

var desks= [['Adam', 'Ben', 'Carl', 'David'],['Edward', 'Frank', 'Georgia', 'Helen'],['Isabelle', 'Joan', 'Kelly', 'Linda']];

```

Lengths
-------

Have a look at the outer loop, it uses `row \< desks.length`. This tells us the length of the first dimension.

```js
12  for(var row= 0; row < desks.length; row++){
```

For the inner loop, we use `column \< desks[row].length`.

```js
14    for(var column= 0; column < desks[row].length; column++){
```

This tells us the length of the internal array for row `row`, in other words, the number of columns in the current row.

Loop through everything
-----------------------

You can see that we actually have a *nested loop* inside another loop.

```js
12  for(var row= 0; row < desks.length; row++){
```

* The first loop iterates through each *row*. So when it enters the loop for the first time, it is grabbing data for the first row.

```js
14  for(var column= 0; column < desks[row].length; column++){
```

* The second loop then loops through all the *columns*.

Reference an element
--------------------

If we reference the array as `desks[1][2]` we will get the value `’Georgia’`. In this section we reference the row and column we want to print.

```js
15  console.log('row[' +row+ ']col[' +column+ ']= ' +desks[row][column]);
```

2\. 3\. Creating a dynamic 2D array
===================================

Writing code to create two-dimensional arrays is logical but it can be a bit fiddly. The Flode chart on the left illustrates a 2D array visually to try and make the concept a bit easier to understand!

Step through the chart
----------------------

Use the ‘Step’ feature to step through the Flode chart so you can see exactly how the array `a2d` changes at each stage of the process.

2\. 4\. Dynamic 2D array in Javascript
======================================

Look at the example code on the left. The code creates a new array and populates it with some rows and columns.

Each ‘cell’ in the array is filled when the code runs.

```js

// Create an empty array first
// This gives us our first dimension
var array = []

// A couple of variables for fun
var rows = 5
var cols = 4

// We work through the rows first, dimension 1
for (var i=0; i < rows; i++ ) {
  // Make array[i] an empty array
  // This is the 2nd dimension
  array[i] = []
  for (var j=0; j < cols; j++ ) {
    // Now we can write to a 'cell'
    // You could read [i] as the row
    // and [j] as the column
    array[i][j] = i + ',' + j
  }
}

console.log(array)

```

3\. Challenges
==============

On the next few pages are some challenges so you can try out what you’ve just learned.

3\. 1\. Easy peasy
==================

We pass in a 2 dimensional array. You should output the 3rd element of the 2nd row.

```js

// Get input from the command line arguments
var inputArray= process.argv.slice(2)

// split up the arguments into a 2d array
for(var i=0; i < inputArray.length; i++){
  inputArray[i]= inputArray[i].split(",")
}

// Your code goes here

```

3\. 2\. List 'em out
====================

We will pass in a 2 dimensional array of numbers.

You should

* add up all the numbers in each row and output that number
* output the grand total of all rows

```js

// Get input from the command line arguments
var inputArray= process.argv.slice(2)

// split up the arguments into a 2d array
for(var i=0; i < inputArray.length; i++){
  inputArray[i]= inputArray[i].split(",")
}

// Your code goes here


```

3\. 3\. Dynamic creation
========================

We pass in 2 numbers, A and B. You should create an array with A rows and B columns.

You should then populate each cell like this …

* 'R0C0’, 'R0C1’, ‘R0C2’ etc.

```js

// Get our command line arguments
var B = process.argv.pop()
var A = process.argv.pop()

// Your code goes here


```
