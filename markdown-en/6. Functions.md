1\. Introduction
================

This unit teaches you how to create functions in JavaScript.

Below you can see a simple function:

```js
function volCylinder( radius, height ) {
  return Math.PI * radius * radius * height
}

// Calculate the volume of a cylinder 
// of radius=4 and height=10
vol = volCylinder(4, 10)
```

1\. 1\. Experiments
===================

This window is provided for you to try out any code you develop. Use it to experiment and practise.

```js
// Write your experimental code below
// 

console.log('your experiments file')


```

[RUN CODE]()

Functions are used a great deal in programming, and this is for a good reason. Functions are one of the most powerful constructs available to you as a programmer.

Definition
----------

* A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task.
* A function is packaged up as a unit.
* A function can be called with inputs.
* A function can return data.

Code that is often or repetitively needed is neatly packaged and given a name so that it can be used as often as you like from wherever you like in a program.

### Programming principles

*Information hiding* is the principle of treating a list of tasks as a single task whilst ignoring the details. For example, instead of writing all the steps to make a cup of tea, I simply think of one step, “make tea.” Functions allow me to create a way to hide the multiple steps of a task behind a single step: this is the function call.

*Modularity* is the process of writing software so that sections can be replaced without affecting other sections. By using functions, the code inside the function can be changed without changing the code outside the function.

2\. 1\. A simple function
=========================

```js

// caclulate the volume of a cylinder
function volumeCylinder( radius, height ) {
  var v = Math.PI * radius * radius * height
  return v
}

console.log ( 'r,   h  => V')
console.log ( '10,  20    ' + volumeCylinder( 10, 20 ) )
console.log ( '1,   10    ' + volumeCylinder( 1, 10 ) )
console.log ( '125, 2520  ' + volumeCylinder( 125, 2520 ) )

```

[RUN THE CODE]()

On the left is a simple example that shows a function `volumeCylinder()` that has two arguments.

The program calculates the volume of a cylinder, using the formula:

V=π∗radius2∗heightV=π∗radius2∗height

Any number of arguments
-----------------------

So, a function can take as many arguments as it needs. The calling function will typically pass as many parameters as the function specifies arguments.

2\. 2\. A function in detail
============================

Have a look at the function `volumeCylinder()`. Below is an explanation of how this function is constructed.

```js

// caclulate the volume of a cylinder
function volumeCylinder( radius, height ) {
  var v = Math.PI * radius * radius * height
  return v
}

console.log ( 'r,   h  => V')
console.log ( '10,  20    ' + volumeCylinder( 10, 20 ) )
console.log ( '1,   10    ' + volumeCylinder( 1, 10 ) )
console.log ( '125, 2520  ' + volumeCylinder( 125, 2520 ) )

```

```
[RUN THE CODE]()
```

```js
function volumeCylinder( radius, height ) { 
    var v = Math.PI * radius * radius * height
    return v 
} 
```

An alternative way to write the code is like this:

```js
function volumeCylinder( radius, height ) { 
    return Math.PI * radius * radius * height 
} 
```

**Function name
**

****

To name a function you use the same rules that apply to a variable. In this case, the function is called `volumeCylinder()`.

Code block
----------

The function gets its own code block (just like an `if` statement or a `for`loop). The block starts with a `{` and is followed by as many lines of code as you want. At the end of the code block is a closing `}`.

Arguments
---------

After the function name come any *arguments* that the function receives. Some functions do not take any arguments.

You can think of an argument as a variable. In our example, the arguments are `radius` and `height`. Within your function’s code block, you can now treat this argument as if it were a variable.

The main thing to note here is that the calling function takes a *parameter*that maps to this argument. Look at the function call below as an example:

```
vol = volumeCylinder(10, 30) 
```

* `10` is the 1st parameter and is passed to the `radius` argument of the function.
* `30` is the 2nd parameter and is passed to the `height` argument.

Return
------

Below is a summary of the use of the `return` statement within a function:

* All functions return control back to the line of code that called them whether you include an return statement or not.
* If you don’t include an explicit `return` statement in your function, then it will return when execution reaches the end of the code block.
* A `return` statement without an expression after it will simply return to the calling code.
* A `return` statement with an expression after it will return that value back to the line of code that called it. In the above example, that value is then assigned to `vol`.

2\. 3\. Why functions? part I
=============================

Here is an example of some more complex code that is badly written. The reasons why the code is bad will be discussed on the next page.

```js
//
// FIRST ONE
// 
var radius1= 2
var height1= 4
var circle1= radius1 * radius1           // area of bottom
var volume1= Math.PI * circle1 * height1 // figure volume
var weight1= volume1 * 4                 // figure weight
console.log( weight1 )

//
// SECOND ONE
// 
var radius2= 5
var height2= 7
var circle2= radius2 * radius2           // area of bottom
var volume2= Math.PI * circle2 * height2 // figure volume
var weight2= volume2 * height2           // figure weight
console.log( weight2 )

//
// THIRD ONE
// 
var radius3= 1
var height3= 35
var circle3= radius3 * radius3           // area of bottom
var volume3= Math.PI * circle3 * height3 // figure volume
var weight3= volume3 * 8                 // figure weight
console.log( weight3 )


```

[RUN THE CODE]()

Look at the blocks of code FIRST ONE, SECOND ONE and THIRD ONE. See how they are all doing the exact same thing?

Don’t worry too much what the code is doing other than that each block of code is doing the same thing.

Now go to the next page.

2\. 4\. Why functions? part II
==============================

On the left you will see code that does exactly the same thing in the correct way, by using a function.

```js
// calculate the area of a circle
function areaCircle(radius){
  return radius * radius
}

// calculate the volume of a cylinder
function volumeCylinder( radius, height ) {
  return Math.PI * areaCircle(radius) * height
}

// calculate the weight of a cylynder (per unit)
function weightCylinder( radius, height, weight ) {
  return volumeCylinder( radius, height ) * weight
}

var radius1= 2
var height1= 4
var weight1= weightCylinder(radius1, height1, 4) // calculate the weight
console.log( weight1 )

var radius2= 5
var height2= 7
var weight2= weightCylinder(radius2, height2, 6) // calculate the weight
console.log( weight2 )

var radius3= 1;
var height3= 35;
var weight3= weightCylinder(radius3, height3, 8) // calculate the weight
console.log( weight3 )
```

[RUN THE CODE]()

Why is it better?
-----------------

One of the *Programming Principles* for this unit is **information hiding**. This is accomplished here by hiding the calculations necessary to calculate the weight of a cylinder behind a single function call.

### Duplication

The reason this code is better is that there are no duplicated bits of code.

In the example the function is only called a couple of times, but imagine you needed to use this code in one-hundred different places and you coded it in the way it was done on the previous page. Now, you would have the same bit of code repeated over and over in one-hundred different places.

What would happen if later you found out that that bit of code has a bug in it? You would have to go and fix the code over and over in one-hundred places.

### Legibility

Another really important reason that this code is better is that it is **much**easier to read.

Instead of having to decipher lots of lines of code (the code that you moved to a function could have been hundreds of lines long) you can now read a nice, meaningful name and know immediately what it does.

3\. Challenges
==============

Now you are ready to try some challenges and test your knowledge of functions.

Testing your functions
----------------------

In these challenges, you will write functions that will be called for you. You can test these out easily directly in your code as shown in the earlier example:

```js
// caclulate the volume of a cylinder
function volumeCylinder( radius, height ) {
  return Math.PI * radius * radius * height
}

console.log( 'r=10, h=20 => V=' + volumeCylinder( 10, 20 ) )
```

You can call your function anywhere outside the function as `value = volumeCylinder(10,20)` does above.

3\. 1\. Random integer
======================

### Random Integer

Write a function called `randomInteger` that takes two number parameters `min` and `max` and returns a random integer value between `min` and `max`.

```js

// Write your code here


function randomInteger(min, max) {
  
  return  Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
}
```

3\. 2\. Hunt for red
====================

### Is Red

Write a function `isRed` that takes a string `str` and determines if the string contains the word 'red’. If it does return `true` else return `false`.

You will need to use the `str.lastIndexOf('characters to look for')` or `str.indexOf('characters to look for')` method which return a valid index if the string was found or `-1` if it wasn’t.

```js

// Write your code here

function isRed(str){
  
  if ( str.indexOf("red")>= 0) 
    return true;
  return false;
}
```
