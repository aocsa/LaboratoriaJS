You are now ready to start writing real code.

You can choose between 3 programming languages : JavaScript, Python or Java.

You can select which language you want to work with from the Settings menu in the top toolbar. When you change this, the teaching content will be adjusted automatically.

We would recommend you learn JavaScript as this opens up the world of web development. You can also do ‘server side’ development with JavaScript, this is used for things like writing to files and database handling.

If you have more time, you could learn a second or third language. If you decide to do this the best approach is to work through the course using the JavaScript language first. Once you have completed the course using JavaScript, you will find it much easier to work through the course again using Python or Java. You should also be able to work much more quickly the second and third time around!

1\. 1\. Inputs and outputs
==========================

The way you handle inputs and outputs in code is very similar to the diagrams you have used in Flode.

Click the button below to run the code on the left. The results of the program will appear just below the button.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var digit1 = 123 // prompt
var digit2 = 324 // prompt
var digit3 = 546 // prompt

// The variables digit1, digit2, and digit3 are now assigned 
// values passed into the program.

// Do some math
var num = digit1 * (digit2 + digit3)

// the variable num now contains the results of our math

// Print some output
console.log('Our Results:')
console.log('digit1 = ' + digit1)
console.log('digit2 = ' + digit2)
console.log('digit3 = ' + digit3)
console.log('num = ' + num)
```

Inputs
------

You will get input for your code from the command line. JavaScript makes this easy by providing access to the command line arguments like this:

```js
var digit1 = prompt("input 1")
var digit2 = prompt("input 2")
var digit3 = prompt("input 3")
```

You will learn more about how this works later. For now, this will be provided for you.

Outputs
-------

To output data, use the `console.log()` function as shown on the left. This can contain any valid JavaScript expressions.

1\. 2\. Errors
==============

You will often make mistakes when writing code. You will soon get used to this, what is important is developing the skill of learning how to understand the errors and then fix them (debugging).

Look at the code on the left. This code contains a simple syntax error.

Now press the button below to run the code.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var digit1 = 123 // prompt
var digit2 = 324 // prompt
var digit3 = 546 // prompt


// There's an error on this line
var num = digit1 + digit4

// Output
console.log('digit1 = ' + digit1)
console.log('digit2 = ' + digit2)
console.log('digit3 = ' + digit3)
console.log('num = ' + num)

```

[RUN THE CODE ]()

When you run the code, you will see an error appear.

Understanding the error
-----------------------

The error looks quite unfriendly. However, if you read the error carefully and look back through your code, you should be able to work out what to do to fix it. Have a look at the explanation below.

This is the error message:

```
ReferenceError: digit4 is not defined 
```

Let’s break it down:

* `ReferenceError:` This is simply telling us that there is an error.
* `digit4 is not defined` This is telling us that that the variable `digit4` is not defined anywhere in our code although we have tried to use it.

The information that comes below these initial lines is really for more advanced debugging situations and can be safely ignored for now.

1\. 3\. Experiments
===================

This window is provided for you to try out any code you develop. Use it to experiment and practise.

There is some starter code provided for you. This code will be explained on the following pages.

```js

// Write some code below

console.log('your experiments file')

```

1\. 4\. Semicolons
==================

You may have been told that you need to put semicolons `;` at the end of each line in JavaScript code. **This is not true**.

You *can* put semicolons at the end of each line but you certainly don’t have to. There are only 2 special cases where this is needed and you won’t encounter these cases until you are much more advanced and even then it will be very rare.

So, our advice is to not use any semicolons at all. At Codio, we don’t use them at all for our development.

2\. Numeric expressions
=======================

Let’s start off by looking at a Flode chart that demonstrates a numeric expression.

If you step through the chart you will see that it evaluates the expressions A∗(B+C)

On the next page you will see exactly the same code written in JavaScript.

2\. 1\. Code equivalent
=======================

On the left is the JavaScript code equivalent of the Flode chart from the previous page.

If you run the code you will see that it deals with the numeric expression in exactly the same way as the Flode chart did.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var input0 = 1213
var input1 = 123
var input2 = 322

// More code
var num = input0 * (input1 + input2)

// A debug statement
console.info('num is ' + num)

// Output
console.log(num)

```

2\. 2\. Addition
================

Challenge
---------

Your code should expect one input. All you need to do is add 12 to it and output the result.

```js

// Get input from the command line
// Make sure the input is stored as a Number
var input = +process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here


```

[CHECK CODE!]()

2\. 3\. A\*(B + C/3)
====================

We pass in three inputs, A, B and C. 

You should output A∗(B+C3).

```js

// Get our input from the command line
// Make sure the input is stored as a Number
var A = +process.argv[2]
var B = +process.argv[3]
var C = +process.argv[4]

// Your code goes here

```

3\. String expressions
======================

Look at the Flode chart on the left. If you step through it, you will see how Flode handles strings. On the next page, you will learn how to do the same thing using code.

When you step through the Flode chart, you can see what happens to the variables after each operation.

![Screenshot 2017-07-12 13.25.23.png](resources/A902CDBB2A2958B283F8419EE6D1783F.png)

3\. 1\. Code equivalent
=======================

On the left you can see the Flode chart is now represented using the code equivalent.

As you can see, it’s almost exactly the same.

```js

var str = 'Hello'             // Create a string variable
var newStr = str + ' world!'  // 'Hello world!'
console.log(newStr)           // output

newStr = '123' + 10           // '12310'
console.log(newStr)           // output

newStr  = '123' + '456'       // '123456'
console.log(newStr)           // output

```

3\. 2\. Joining strings
=======================

We are providing a string as an input to your program.

Your job is to add the string `, hello!` to the string we provide you and then output it.

Make sure you include the space after the comma!

```js

// Get input from the command line
var inputText = process.argv[2]

// Your code goes here

```

[CHECK CODE!]()

3\. 3\. Joining more strings
============================

We will provide 2 strings to your program.

Your job is to join the strings together so you get a single string with a space between the 2 original strings.

This is a common case is coding and you will need to create your output by joining the inputs and adding the space in the middle.

```js

// Get input from the command line
var string1 = process.argv[2]
var string2 = process.argv[3]

// Your code goes here

```
